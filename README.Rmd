## My CV
This repository contains my curriculum vitae developed using the excellent vitae package in RMarkdown. 

```{r vitae, echo=TRUE}
citation("vitae")
```

The package has a number of different templates that you can use to develop your cv (https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae). My current favourite is the "moderncv" template. This is the one I have decided to use. I have experimented with the "awesomecv", which is as the name suggests awesome! It is probably a little too awesome for me though - I like the colour and layout but I need to adjust the colour of the titles to be either one letter or the whole word (three letters looks odd). 

Here is a version of my CV in the moderncv template:
