# Current Role
**Researcher I**, [Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA)](https://www.nina.no/english), 2019-present  
- I am an ecologist and researcher at the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, specialising in biodiversity and wildlife management. With a strong foundation in quantitative methods, ecological modelling, and meta-analysis, I have contributed to a variety of studies aimed at understanding the impacts of land-use change, climate change, and conservation efforts on wildlife populations. Through rigorous evidence synthesis and systematic reviews, I work to ensure that ecological research translates into effective, data-driven decision-making for conservation and environmental policy. My research integrates cutting-edge methods and statistical techniques to forecast biodiversity outcomes and improve conservation strategies in a rapidly changing world.
