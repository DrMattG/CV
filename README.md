Curriculum vitae
================

## My CV

This repository contains my curriculum vitae developed using the
excellent vitae package in RMarkdown.

``` r
citation("vitae")
```

    ## 
    ## To cite package 'vitae' in publications use:
    ## 
    ##   Mitchell O'Hara-Wild and Rob Hyndman (2021). vitae: Curriculum Vitae
    ##   for R Markdown. R package version 0.4.2.
    ##   https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vitae
    ## 
    ## A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is
    ## 
    ##   @Manual{,
    ##     title = {vitae: Curriculum Vitae for R Markdown},
    ##     author = {Mitchell O'Hara-Wild and Rob Hyndman},
    ##     year = {2021},
    ##     note = {R package version 0.4.2},
    ##     url = {https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vitae},
    ##   }

The package has a number of different templates that you can use to
develop your cv (<https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae>). My
current favourite is the “moderncv” template. This is the one I have
decided to use. I have experimented with the “awesomecv”, which is as
the name suggests awesome\! It is probably a little too awesome for me
though - I like the colour and layout but I need to adjust the colour of
the titles to be either one letter or the whole word (three letters
looks odd).

Here is a version of my CV in the moderncv template:
